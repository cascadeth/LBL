This style will "trim down" your TD pages for a "Skinny TeamDynamix" (yeah 
couldn't resist the pun... and I know it doesn't work!).  Namely: make the 
forms not force you to scroll all the time to set fields when editing tickets.  
Like seriously, having to scroll to set the *STATUS* field is an incredibly 
poor design choice, as that is something that needs to be set on every ticket.

It is intended to be used alongside other non-layout styles, but will work well
with just about anything that doesn't conflict, like another layout style.

I also have a few more tweaks, like making the Status field be the first field 
in the forms.  There are options that will remove fields that are rarely used 
that are commented, and you can uncomment for use.  I have comments for each part 
that explains what it does.

I can add a "suggested" preset for the field hiding if requested, but otherwise 
assuming that it's not something worth adding.
